This is one of the personal project that I have been working.

The project has the same requirements of my group project that I did during my bachelors but I am trying to improve the code.

Is a embedded sytem that can detect the temperature and humitiy. It will blink RED if temperature outside the range. Blue
blink if Humidity is outside the range. If both humidity and temperature are outside range, it will flash Red and Blue. Green blink is if both Humidity and Temperature are in range.

You can change the temperature with the rotary encoder. If you press the switcher you can change state and with the button of the rotary encoder you can set the temperature and humidity accordingly.

You will need to make sure that you have installed the libraries that are on the platformio.ini.

Don't forget to have the same pin numbers on your hardware. 

Pictures of the hardware.
